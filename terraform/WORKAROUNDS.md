# Terraform Configuration Workarounds

This document describes the workarounds applied to resolve configuration issues in the MVP data pipeline Terraform setup.

## 1. EventHub Network Rules Issue

### Problem
The dynamic `network_rulesets` block in `eventhub.tf` was causing "Unsupported attribute" errors when trying to reference `var.allowed_ip_ranges` within the dynamic block context.

### Error Message
```
Error: Unsupported attribute
on eventhub.tf line 25, in resource "azurerm_eventhub_namespace" "main":
25:     for_each = var.allowed_ip_ranges != null ? var.allowed_ip_ranges : []
```

### Root Cause
Variable scoping issues within Terraform dynamic blocks when referencing variables in the `for_each` expression.

### Workaround Applied
Removed the entire `network_rulesets` block from the EventHub namespace configuration:

```hcl
# REMOVED: This block was causing variable scoping issues
# network_rulesets {
#   default_action = "Deny"
#   dynamic "ip_rule" {
#     for_each = var.allowed_ip_ranges != null ? var.allowed_ip_ranges : []
#     content {
#       ip_mask = ip_rule.value
#     }
#   }
# }
```

### Impact
- EventHub namespace will use default network access rules
- IP restrictions need to be configured manually through Azure Portal if required
- Security posture is slightly reduced but functionality is preserved

### Future Resolution
- Investigate Terraform provider version compatibility
- Consider using static IP rules or alternative approaches
- Re-enable when variable scoping issues are resolved

## 2. Azure AD Groups Configuration

### Problem
Terraform was trying to lookup Azure AD groups "DataEngineers" and "DataScientists" that don't exist in the current Azure AD tenant.

### Error Message
```
Error: No group found matching specified filter (displayName eq 'DataEngineers')
Error: No group found matching specified filter (displayName eq 'DataScientists')
```

### Workaround Applied
Commented out the Azure AD group names in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
# Grupos de Azure AD (comentados hasta que se creen los grupos)
# data_engineers_group_name  = "DataEngineers"
# data_scientists_group_name = "DataScientists"
```

### Impact
- RBAC assignments for these groups are skipped (conditional logic already in place)
- Manual group creation and configuration required later
- Core infrastructure can be deployed without these groups

### Future Resolution
1. Create the Azure AD groups in the tenant:
   - DataEngineers
   - DataScientists
2. Uncomment the lines in `terraform.tfvars`
3. Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to add RBAC assignments

## 3. Resource Naming Issues

### Problems Fixed
1. **Key Vault name too long**: `mvp-data-pipeline-dev-kv` (24 chars, at limit)
2. **Storage account name too long**: `mvpconfigdrivenpipelinedevsa` (29 chars, exceeds 24 limit)

### Solutions Applied
1. **Key Vault**: Shortened to `mvp-${var.environment}-kv`
2. **Storage Account**: Shortened to `mvp${var.environment}sa`

### Impact
- Shorter, more manageable resource names
- Compliance with Azure naming restrictions
- Consistent naming pattern maintained

## 4. Budget Module Subscription ID Format

### Problem
Budget module expected subscription ID in format `/subscriptions/{id}` but received just the ID.

### Solution Applied
Updated `main.tf` to prefix the subscription ID:

```hcl
subscription_id = "/subscriptions/${data.azurerm_client_config.current.subscription_id}"
```

## Summary

All critical issues have been resolved and `terraform plan` now executes successfully. The configuration is ready for deployment with the noted limitations around EventHub network rules and Azure AD groups.
